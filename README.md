# Coffee Mate API

This is the backend of my capstone project for Ada Developers Academy. Made with Ruby on Rails, this API consists of coffee shop data.

Deployed by using Docker and hosted on Amazon EC2.

### Base URL
http://52.25.68.111/

### GET /match
  This will return the search results of matched coffee shops based on the following criteria:

| Key        | Value          |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| neighborhood     | string | 
| parking     | street OR lot     | 
| wifi| true OR false     | 
| food | true OR false     | 

### Example:
```
GET http://52.25.68.111/match?neighborhood=Capitol Hill&parking=street&wifi=true&food=false
```
Will return:
